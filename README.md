---------

This is an Android app developed for Udacity's "Developing Android Apps" course, facilitated by the [GDG Alameda Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/GDGAlameda/) from February to April 2015.

With this app, users can track how much time they spend at specific places, using Google's Places API to retrieve information about the location they selected.

In future versions the app will present insights about time spent per person with a breakdown per category, week days and more.

Screenshots and information about the submission to Udacity can be found in the `SupportingDocs` folder.
